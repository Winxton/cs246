a) The order for the inner and outer loops are different. "arrays" goes in the order of rows first, then columns, wheras "arrays2" is the other way around.

b) arrays: 0.359s
   arrays2: 1.244s

c) The storage location of rows in a 2d array are within close storage locations (spatial locality). A cache uses this locality by storing recently referenced data and its neighbors 
(in consequtive address blocks), so when the loop is going through elements in the same row, 
neighboring elements in that row are brought into the cache, hence allowing faster traversal.
