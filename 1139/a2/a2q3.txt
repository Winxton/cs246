a) The expected output is 1, but the actual output is 1.00005
b) This is because the floating point number 0.0001 cannot be represented accurately, since there is a finite amount of memory to store an exact number. When the code is compiled, the number "0.0001" is rounded to the nearest number in binary floating point, which results in a small rounding error.
